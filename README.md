# Visualisation-of-Lee-s-Algorithm-for-pathfinding
This is a path find visualizer created by me. Once you compile & run the program, you have to select a start point and a stop point. Then you will be able to create walls for the maze.

To select start/stop point or to create a wall enter its position! To undo a wall enter its position!

After you created the walls press 4 to start!

In the end it will display, if it's possible, the longest path from start to end point, otherwise it's prints a message to inform that the end point is not reachable.

Have fun with it!:)
